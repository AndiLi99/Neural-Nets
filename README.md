# Neural-Nets

This project contains different neural networks I have worked on, written in Python.
The file "functions.py" contains the non-linear functions such as sigmoid and tanh as well as various cost functions like cross-entropy.

Currently, I have created a feedforward neural network and a recurrent neural network without the use of machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow.

My goal is to learn how different types of neural networks work and the math behind them.

Requirements:
numpy
