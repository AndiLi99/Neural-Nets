# Neural-Nets

This project contains different neural networks I have worked on, written in Python.
The file "functions.py" contains the non-linear functions such as sigmoid and tanh as well as various cost functions like cross-entropy.

Currently, I have created a feedforward neural network and a recurrent neural network.

Requirements:
numpy
